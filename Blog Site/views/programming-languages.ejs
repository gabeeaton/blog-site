            <h1>Decoding Programming Languages: What Each Language Does Best</h1>
            <p>
                Programming languages are powerful tools that enable developers to create a wide range of software applications. However, each language has its strengths and weaknesses, making it essential for developers to choose the right tool for the job. In this article, we'll explore some of the most popular programming languages and what they excel at.
            </p>
            <h2>Python</h2>
            <p>
                Python is known for its simplicity and readability, making it an excellent choice for beginners and experienced developers alike. It's widely used in web development, data analysis, artificial intelligence, and scientific computing. Python's extensive standard library and third-party packages make it versatile and suitable for a wide range of applications.
            </p>
            <h2>JavaScript</h2>
            <p>
                JavaScript is the language of the web, powering dynamic and interactive web applications. It's essential for front-end development, enabling developers to create responsive user interfaces and interactive web experiences. JavaScript is also used for server-side development with Node.js and for building cross-platform mobile apps with frameworks like React Native.
            </p>
            <h2>Java</h2>
            <p>
                Java is a robust and platform-independent language known for its performance and scalability. It's widely used in enterprise applications, Android app development, and large-scale systems. Java's strong typing and object-oriented features make it suitable for building complex, mission-critical applications.
            </p>
            <h2>C++</h2>
            <p>
                C++ is a powerful and efficient programming language used in system programming, game development, and performance-critical applications. It excels at tasks requiring low-level memory manipulation and high performance. C++ is ideal for resource-constrained environments and real-time systems.
            </p>
            <h2>SQL</h2>
            <p>
                SQL is a specialized language designed for managing and manipulating relational databases. Its primary strength lies in its ability to query and manipulate data efficiently. SQL excels at tasks such as data retrieval, insertion, deletion, and modification. It is widely used in database management systems (DBMS) like MySQL, PostgreSQL, and Oracle.
            </p>
            <h2>C#</h2>
            <p>
                C# is a modern and versatile programming language developed by Microsoft. It excels at building desktop applications, games (with Unity), and enterprise-level web applications. C# is known for its robust type system, rich libraries, and seamless integration with the .NET framework.
